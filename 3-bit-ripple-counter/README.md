# 3 bit ripple counter

Here you will find a logicly simulation of a 3 bit ripple counter constructed out of NOR logic.

This was covered in a blog post here: [Clock design notes #4 - ripple counters](https://ornotblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/clock-design-notes-4-ripple-counters.html)

The .logicly files can be opened using software from <http://logic.ly>.
