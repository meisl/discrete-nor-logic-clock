# 16 segment decoders

Here are the design files for 2 different 16 segment decoders:

* Day of Week decoder, takes a 3 bit BCD value and displays MO, TU, WE .. SU, or blank for value 7
* Month decoder, takes a 4 bit BCD value and displays JAN, FEB, MAR .. DEC, or blank for values 12-15

The design of these decoders is covered in a blog post here: [Clock design notes #3 - 16 segment decoders](https://ornotblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/clock-design-notes-3-16-segment-decoders.html)

The above blog post is essentially a continuation of [Clock design notes #2 - 7 segment decoders](https://ornotblog.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/clock-design-notes-2-7-segment-decoders.html).

The .logicly files can be opened using software from <http://logic.ly>.
